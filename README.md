## üìã Problem Statement & Progress

**Problem Statement:** Develop a Skill Swap Platform ‚Äî a mini application enabling users to list their skills and request others in return. Features include basic info (name, optional location/photo), lists of skills offered/wanted, availability settings (weekends, evenings), public/private profiles, search/browse by skill (e.g., Photoshop, Excel), request/accept/reject swap offers, view current and pending swap requests, delete unaccepted requests, ratings/feedback post-swap, and an Admin role for moderating spam/inappropriate descriptions, banning users, monitoring swap statuses, sending platform-wide messages, and downloading activity/feedback/swap reports.

**Progress:** We have finalized the UI/UX wireframes for Discovery, Profile Detail, Swap Request Modal, Swap Management, Unified Dashboard, Chatbot, and Admin Console. The project structure is set up in React/TypeScript with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion; we‚Äôve implemented modular components, validation patterns, and coding standards. The frontend is deployed to Vercel for fast previews; backend endpoints will integrate as soon as development completes.
